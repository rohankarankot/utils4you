## How to Use This Guide

1.  **Don't Memorize; Internalize:** The 500+ word explanations are designed to give you the "Why" and the "How," not just the "What." Focus on the mental models and architectural trade-offs.
2.  **Adapt the Scenarios:** Each section contains a `Real-world Production Scenario`. Use these as templates to articulate your own experiences from your 6-8 years of career history.
3.  **Anticipate Follow-ups:** Review the `Follow-up Questions Interviewers Ask` at the end of each question. These are designed to dig deeper into the "gotchas" and edge cases.
4.  **T-Systems Alignment:** Section H, Q4 specifically aligns your background with T-Systems' business model in automotive, telco, and healthcare sectors.

## Preparation Strategy for Senior Candidates

-   **Architecture first:** For every coding question, explain the *architecture* before you write a single line.
-   **Performance-conscious:** Always mention the performance implications (e.g., LCP, Re-renders, Bundle weight) of your chosen solution.
-   **Business Value:** Relate technical choices back to business outcomes (e.g., "This saves us 30% in cloud costs" or "This increases conversion by 5%").
